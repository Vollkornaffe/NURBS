#General Idea
This is just a hobby project concerned with NURBS.

The idea is to have a cpp library that can generate a number of samples given control points and intervals.

Contrary to most NURBS libraries this one is circular NURBS only.

There is also a python interface with ctypes & python scripts to use this in blender.

#Installing
The installation is via cmake.
Two paths need to be specified 

- pydest
- libdest

#Usage
todo
